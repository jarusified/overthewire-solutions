This task is pretty easy,

It has been given in the question that the format is unsigned integer in little endian format. All the packets in the network are packed and sent in
order to reduce the bandwidth and python struct module is very helpful in packing and unpacking binary strings. 


'@' 'native, native'
'=' 'native, standard'
'<' 'little-endian'
'>' 'big-endian
'!', 'network'

we specify a format string according to which the whole string is packed and rest is simple.

we iterate 4 times just because while sending the data over the network we dunno the exact size (it is given in the question as 4).

so voila....
